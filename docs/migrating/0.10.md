# Migrating to version 0.10.x (from 0.9.x)

## Server-side

- `EntityMap<T>` has been removed. If you're using `EntityMap<T>` to describe a map of entities, you should use the plain TypeScript alternative now. e.g. Replace "`EntityMap<Player>`" with "`{[id: string]: Player}`".

### New default serializer

Colyseus 0.10 has introduced a new serialization method ([`SchemaSerializer`](/state/schema/)). Even though it's recommened to use the new serializer, you can continue using the previous one ([`FossilDeltaSerializer`](/state/fossil-delta/)).

#### I want to continue using the previous serializer

No problem, check below how to continue using the previous serializer using TypeScript or plain JavaScript.

```javascript fct_label="TypeScript"
import { Room, FossilDeltaSerializer, serialize } from "colyseus";

@serialize(FossilDeltaSerializer)
class MyRoom extends Room {
    // your room definition
}
```

```javascript fct_label="JavaScript"
const colyseus = require('colyseus');

class MyRoom extends colyseus.Room {
    // your room definition
}
colyseus.serialize(colyseus.FossilDeltaSerializer)(MyRoom);
```

#### I want to migrate to the new serializer

Great, hopefully you won't have to make many changes in your project. In the client-side, the way to listen for state patches has changed slightly.

- See [how to use the new `SchemaSerializer` in the server-side](/state/schema/#server-side).
- See [how to listen for changes in the state using `SchemaSerializer`](/state/schema/#client-side).
