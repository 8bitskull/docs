# Migrating to version 0.11.x (from 0.10.x)

The version `0.11` improves match-making and (hopefully) scalability, and introduces breaking changes in both client-side and server-side.

## Client-side

### New match-making methods available in the client-side!

A few methods have been added to the client-side allowing to explicitly create rooms or join them.

- `joinOrCreate(roomName, options)` - joins or creates a room by name (previously known by `join()`)
- `create(roomName, options)` - only creates new rooms
- `join(roomName, options)` - only joins existing rooms by name
- `joinById(roomId, options)` - only joins existing rooms by id
- `reconnect(roomId, sessionId)` - re-establish a previously lost connection (previously known as `rejoin()`)

The `join(roomName, options)` method has been renamed to `joinOrCreate()`. Replace your existing `client.join()` calls to its new API:

```typescript fct_label="JavaScript"
client.joinOrCreate("battle", {/* options */}).then(room => {
  console.log("joined successfully", room);
}).catch(e => {
  console.error("join error", e);
});
```

```csharp fct_label="C#"
try {
  Room<YourStateClass> room = await client.JoinOrCreate<YourStateClass>("battle", /* Dictionary of options */);
  Debug.Log("joined successfully");

} catch (ex) {
  Debug.Log("join error");
  Debug.Log(ex.Message);
}
```

```lua fct_label="lua"
client:join_or_create("battle", {--[[options]]}, function(err, room)
  if (err ~= nil) then
    print("join error: " .. err)
    return
  end

  print("joined successfully")
end)
```

```haxe fct_label="Haxe"
client.joinOrCreate("battle", [/* options */], YourStateClass, function(err, room) {
  if (err != null) {
    trace("join error: " + err);
    return;
  }

  trace("joined successfully");
});
```

```cpp fct_label="C++"
client->joinOrCreate<YourStateClass>("battle", {/* options */}, [=](std::string err, Room<State>* room) {
  if (err != "") {
    std::cout << "join error: " << err << std::endl;
    return;
  }

  std::cout << "joined successfully" << std::endl;
});
```

## Server-side

### The `requestJoin()` method has been deprecated.

Instead of using `requestJoin()` to determine wheter a player is allowed to join a room, you should use matchmaking filters for your defined rooms.

Take this example on version `0.10`.

```typescript
// version 0.10
onInit(options) {
  this.progress = options.progress;
}

requestJoin(options, isNew) {
  return this.progress === options.progress;
}
```

You can have the same behaviour by defining a `progress` filter when defining your room:

```typescript
// version 0.11
gameServer
  .define("dungeon", DungeonRoom)
  .filterBy(['progress']);
```
