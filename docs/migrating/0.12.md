# Migrating to version 0.12.x (from 0.11.x)

Version `0.12.x` has mostly internal improvements and bug fixes.

Please install the latest version of the server, as well as the client:

**Upgrading the server:**

```
npm install colyseus@^0.12.0 --save
```

**Upgrading the client:**

```
npm install colyseus.js@^0.12.0 --save
```

If you're using Unity or other client, please check on its respective repository on GitHub. If you have questions feel free to ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RY8rRS7)

## Using `this.broadcast()` during `onJoin()` in the server

The version `0.11.x` introduced a bug where `this.broadcast()` would not send the message to the current connecting client during `onJoin()` ([#260](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus/issues/260)). Forcing you to also use `this.send(client, ...)` in order for the connecting client to also receive that message. This has been fixed now on `0.12.x`:

```typescript
class MyRoom extends Room {
  onJoin(client, options) {
    this.broadcast(/* your data */);

    /**
    * IF YOU'RE ALSO USING `this.send()` HERE, YOU CAN SAFELY REMOVE IT,
    * OTHERWISE THE MESSAGE WILL ARIVE TWICE FOR THIS CLIENT
    */
    // this.send(client, /* your data */);
  }
}
```
