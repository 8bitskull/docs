Colyseus is a Authoritative Multiplayer Game Server for Node.js. It allows you to focus on your gameplay instead of bothering about networking.

The mission of this framework is to be the easiest solution for creating your
own multiplayer games in JavaScript.

This framework is fairly new and is being evolved constantly. You're encouraged to take a look on [some games being developed with it](https://discuss.colyseus.io/category/5/showcase) and make your own!

## What Colyseus provides to you:

- WebSocket-based communication
- Simple API in the server-side and client-side.
- Automatic state synchronization between server and client.
- Matchmaking clients into game sessions
- Scale vertically or horizontally

## What Colyseus won't provide:

- Game Engine: Colyseus is agnostic of the engine you're using. Need Physics? Add your own logic / package.
- Database: It's up to you to configure and select which database you'd like to use.

    "Thanks again for this framework... it allowed someone like me who just wants the server to be a black box to focus on my game instead of getting bogged down learning a whole new skill set!"

    Loved the framework. Exactly what we are looking for in terms of features.
