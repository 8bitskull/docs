# [State Handling](/state/overview) Â» Fossil Delta

The `FossilDeltaSerializer` is permissive about which structure you provide as the state. You may provide a raw object, a class instance, and all its [enumerable properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty#Description) are going to be serialized to the clients.

## Server-side

<!-- !!! Tip
    - For synchronization with the client-side, see [client-side state synchronization](/client/state/fossil-delta).
    - See Colyseus' technical approach on [state synchronization](/state/fossil-delta). -->

### Raw Object State

The simplest way to deal with the room state is using a raw JavaScript objects directly in the `Room` handler.

**On the following example, you'll see:**

- Creating player upon client connection.
- Handling client-side actions and updating the state to move `x` position.
- Removing player upon client disconnection.

```typescript
import { Room, Client } from "colyseus";

export class BattleRoom extends Room {

  onInit (options: any) {
    this.setState({
      players: {}
    });
  }

  onJoin (client) {
    this.state.players[ client.sessionId ] = {
      x: 0,
      y: 0
    };
  }

  onLeave (client) {
    delete this.state.players[ client.sessionId ];
  }

  onMessage (client, data) {
    if (data.action === "left") {
      this.state.players[ client.sessionId ].x -= 1;

    } else if (data.action === "right") {
      this.state.players[ client.sessionId ].x += 1;
    }
  }
}
```

### Your Own Data Structures

Whilst it's possible to use raw data directly on `this.state`. The recommended way to handle your state is through your own data structures. By creating your own structures, you can have a more decoupled structure to represent your state.

**On the following (rewritten) example, you'll see:**

- A clean `BattleRoom` implementation, directly coupled to the state structure.
- A large data structure holding the entire room state (`BattleState`)
    - Methods manipulating smaller data structures
- A small decoupled data structure representing a single entity (`Player`)

```typescript fct_label="BattleRoom.ts"
// BattleRoom.ts
import { Room, Client } from "colyseus";
import { BattleState } from "./BattleState";

export class BattleRoom extends Room<BattleState> {

  onInit (options: any) {
    this.setState(new BattleState());
  }

  onJoin (client) {
    this.state.addPlayer(client);
  }

  onLeave (client) {
    this.state.removePlayer(client);
  }

  onMessage (client, data) {
    if (data.action) {
      this.state.movePlayer(client, data.action);
    }
  }
}
```

```typescript fct_label="BattleState.ts"
// BattleState.ts
import { Player } from "./Player";

export class BattleState {
  players: {[id: string]: Player} = {};

  addPlayer (client) {
    this.players[ client.sessionId ] = new Player(0, 0);
  }

  removePlayer (client) {
    delete this.players[ client.sessionId ];
  }

  movePlayer (client, action) {
    if (action === "left") {
      this.players[ client.sessionId ].x -= 1;

    } else if (action === "right") {
      this.players[ client.sessionId ].x += 1;
    }
  }
}
```

```typescript fct_label="Player.ts"
// Player.ts
export class Player {
  constructor (
    public x: number,
    public y: number
  ) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}
```

#### Map of entities 

Since you cannot use `Map` to describe public synchronizeable properties (see [avoid using `Map` and `Set`](#avoid-using-map-set)), you can use a plain JavaScript object to assign keys of `string` to a custom type (`T`).

```ts
players: {[id: string]: Player} = {}
```

```typescript
type EntityMap<T> = {[ entityId:string ]: T};
```

Your state will usualy have at least one usage of `EntityMap` for the map of connected clients. As described on [previous example](#your-own-data-structures).

#### Private variables (`@nosync`)

To prevent private properties from leaking into your clients' state, you need to set those properties as **non-enumerable**. The decorator `@nosync` is a syntax sugar for this purpose.

```typescript
export class Player {
  x: number;
  y: number;

  @nosync
  wontBeSynched: string = "This property won't be synched with clients";
}
```

#### Avoid using `Map`, `Set`

Avoid using `Map` and `Set` for public, synchronizeable, properties.

Unfortunately, the JavaScript built-in types `Map` and `Set` aren't serializeable by default. This means MessagePack cannot encode them properly.

**See why:**

```typescript
var myMap = new Map([["k1", "v1"], ["k2", "v2"]]);
// => Map(2) {"key" => "value", "key2" => "value2"}
JSON.stringify(myMap);
// => "{}"
```

You're encouraged to use them for private variables, though. See [`@nosync`](#private-variables-nosync) for not synchronizeable properties.

#### Avoid mutating arrays

- `push`ing new entries is OK - the clients will receive a single `"add"` operation.
- `pop`ing the last entry is OK - the clients will receive a single `"remove"` operation.

Removing or inserting entries in-between will generate one `"replace"` operation for each entry that had the index changed. Be careful to handle these changes in the client-side properly.

## Client-side

Whenever the [state mutates](/server/room) in the server-side, you can listen to particular variable changes in the client-side.

The `Room` instance in the client-side uses [delta-listener](https://github.com/endel/delta-listener) to allow you to trigger callbacks for particular mutations.

**Example**

Let's say you have a list of entities and its positions in your server-side:

```javascript
class MyRoom extends Room {
    onInit () {
        this.setState({
            entities: {
                "f98h3f": { x: 0, y: 0, hp: 10 },
                "24jgd3": { x: 100, y: 0, hp: 6 }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

In the client-side, you want to listen for mutations in the attributes of these entities. Before being able to catch them, we need to mutate them. The mutation can occur during your simulation interval, or by actions taken by connected clients (during `onMessage` in the server-side).

```javascript
class MyRoom extends Room {
    onInit () {
        // this.setState(...) see above
        this.setSimulationInterval(() => this.update());
    }

    update () {
        for (let entityId in this.state.entities) {
            // simple and naive gravity
            this.state.entities[entityId].y += 1;
        }
    }
}
```

Now that we have the mutations in place, we can listen to them in the client-side. The callback will be called for each attribute, of each entity.

```javascript fct_label="JavaScript"
room.listen("entities/:id/:attribute", (change) => {
    console.log(change.operation); // => "replace" (can be "add", "remove" or "replace")
    console.log(change.path["id"]); // => "f98h3f"
    console.log(change.path["attribute"]); // => "y"
    console.log(change.value); // => 1
})
```

```javascript fct_label="C#"
room.Listen("entities/:id/:attribute", OnAttributeChange);

void OnAttributeChange (DataChange change)
{
    Debug.Log ("OnAttributeChange");
    Debug.Log (change.operation); // => "replace" (can be "add", "remove" or "replace")
    Debug.Log (change.path["id"]); // => "f98h3f"
    Debug.Log (change.path["attribute"]); // => "y"
    Debug.Log (change.value); // => 1
})
```
